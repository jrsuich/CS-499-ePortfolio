## **Introduction**

## **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**
The artifact is a brick-breaking game developed using C++ and the OpenGL/GLFW library, created as part of CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization in July 2024. It demonstrates concepts such as object rendering, collision detection, and dynamic movement, showcasing proficiency in computational graphics, modular design, and interactive gameplay. 

This artifact was chosen for my ePortfolio because it highlights key skills in software development, including OpenGL rendering, collision detection, and game mechanics. The code is modular, leveraging object-oriented programming principles, and showcases problem-solving skills through optimization. Its balance of graphical programming and software engineering principles makes it a strong representation of my capabilities. 

Key components that demonstrate my skills include object-oriented design with classes like Brick, Circle, and Paddle, custom collision detection algorithms, and a modular structure that simplifies future modifications. It also integrates OpenGL for real-time rendering and interactive graphics, further showing my technical expertise.  

Enhancements included improving paddle-ball collision logic, refactoring the code for modularity, supporting window resizing, and balancing the game by adjusting ball speed. These updates improved the user experience and demonstrated my ability to enhance existing code effectively. 

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of OpenGL and graphics programming, enhanced my problem-solving skills, and improved code readability. A challenge like refining collision detection required iterative debugging and creative problem-solving. These experiences contributed to my growth as a developer and aligned with the course outcomes of designing effective solutions, applying software engineering principles, and showcasing creativity.
